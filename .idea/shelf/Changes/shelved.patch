+PCRE2 LICENCE
+-------------
+
+PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
+and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
+
+Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
+licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
+redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
+is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
+testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.
+
+The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
+included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
+optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
+the library is built.

+
+EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
+------------------------------------------
+
+The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
+not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
+PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
+includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
+PCRE2 independently.

+
+    *) Feature: byte ranges support in the ngx_http_gzip_static_module.
+
+    *) Bugfix: port ranges in the "listen" directive did not work; the bug

+       Thanks to Valentin Bartenev.
+
+    *) Bugfix: incorrect location might be chosen to process a request if a
+       prefix location longer than 255 characters was used in the
+       configuration.
+
+    *) Bugfix: non-ASCII characters in file names on Windows were not
+       supported by the ngx_http_autoindex_module, the ngx_http_dav_module,
+       and the "include" directive.
+
+    *) Change: the logging level of the "data length too long", "length too
+       short", "bad legacy version", "no shared signature algorithms", "bad
+       digest length", "missing sigalgs extension", "encrypted length too

+
+Changes with nginx 1.23.3                                        13 Dec 2022
+
+    *) Bugfix: an error might occur when reading PROXY protocol version 2
+       header with large number of TLVs.

+    *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if SSI
+       was used to process subrequests created by other modules.
+       Thanks to Ciel Zhao.

+    *) Workaround: when a hostname used in the "listen" directive resolves
+       to multiple addresses, nginx now ignores duplicates within these
+       addresses.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU during unbuffered proxying if SSL
+       connections to backends were used.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.23.2                                        19 Oct 2022
+
+    *) Security: processing of a specially crafted mp4 file by the
+       ngx_http_mp4_module might cause a worker process crash, worker
+       process memory disclosure, or might have potential other impact
+       (CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2022-41742).
+
+    *) Feature: the "$proxy_protocol_tlv_..." variables.

+
+    *) Bugfix: in logging of the PROXY protocol errors.
+       Thanks to Sergey Brester.
+

+       response.
+
+    *) Bugfix: a proxied response might be truncated during reconfiguration
+       on Linux; the bug had appeared in 1.17.5.

+
+Changes with nginx 1.23.0                                        21 Jun 2022
+
+    *) Change in internal API: now header lines are represented as linked
+       lists.
+
+    *) Change: now nginx combines arbitrary header lines with identical
+       names when sending to FastCGI, SCGI, and uwsgi backends, in the
+       $r->header_in() method of the ngx_http_perl_module, and during lookup
+       of the "$http_...", "$sent_http_...", "$sent_trailer_...",
+       "$upstream_http_...", and "$upstream_trailer_..." variables.
+
+    *) Bugfix: if there were multiple "Vary" header lines in the backend
+       response, nginx only used the last of them when caching.
+
+    *) Bugfix: if there were multiple "WWW-Authenticate" header lines in the
+       backend response and errors with code 401 were intercepted or the
+       "auth_request" directive was used, nginx only sent the first of the
+       header lines to the client.
+
+    *) Change: the logging level of the "application data after close
+       notify" SSL errors has been lowered from "crit" to "info".
+
+    *) Bugfix: connections might hang if nginx was built on Linux 2.6.17 or
+       newer, but was used on systems without EPOLLRDHUP support, notably
+       with epoll emulation layers; the bug had appeared in 1.17.5.
+       Thanks to Marcus Ball.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx did not cache the response if the "Expires" response
+       header line disabled caching, but following "Cache-Control" header
+       line enabled caching.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.21.6                                        25 Jan 2022
+
+    *) Bugfix: when using EPOLLEXCLUSIVE on Linux client connections were
+       unevenly distributed among worker processes.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx returned the "Connection: keep-alive" header line in
+       responses during graceful shutdown of old worker processes.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the "ssl_session_ticket_key" when using TLSv1.3.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.21.5                                        28 Dec 2021

+Changes with nginx 1.21.4                                        02 Nov 2021
+
+    *) Change: support for NPN instead of ALPN to establish HTTP/2
+       connections has been removed.
+
+    *) Change: now nginx rejects SSL connections if ALPN is used by the

+
+    *) Change: the default value of the "sendfile_max_chunk" directive was
+       changed to 2 megabytes.
+

+       ngx_http_mp4_module.
+       Thanks to Tracey Jaquith.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the $content_length variable when using chunked transfer
+       encoding.
+
+    *) Bugfix: after receiving a response with incorrect length from a
+       proxied backend nginx might nevertheless cache the connection.
+       Thanks to Awdhesh Mathpal.
+
+    *) Bugfix: invalid headers from backends were logged at the "info" level
+       instead of "error"; the bug had appeared in 1.21.1.
+
+    *) Bugfix: requests might hang when using HTTP/2 and the "aio_write"
+       directive.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.21.3                                        07 Sep 2021

+    *) Bugfix: backend SSL connections in the stream module might hang after
+       an SSL handshake.
+
+    *) Bugfix: the security level, which is available in OpenSSL 1.1.0 or
+       newer, did not affect loading of the server certificates when set
+       with "@SECLEVEL=N" in the "ssl_ciphers" directive.
+
+    *) Bugfix: SSL connections with gRPC backends might hang if select,
+       poll, or /dev/poll methods were used.

+       and "}" characters when proxying with changed URI.
+
+    *) Bugfix: SSL variables might be empty when used in logs; the bug had
+       appeared in 1.19.5.
+
+    *) Bugfix: keepalive connections with gRPC backends might not be closed
+       after receiving a GOAWAY frame.
+

+       response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
+       attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
+       cause worker process crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution
+       (CVE-2021-23017).
+
+    *) Feature: variables support in the "proxy_ssl_certificate",
+       "proxy_ssl_certificate_key" "grpc_ssl_certificate",
+       "grpc_ssl_certificate_key", "uwsgi_ssl_certificate", and

+       appeared in 1.11.5.
+
+    *) Bugfix: EXTERNAL authentication mechanism in mail proxy was accepted
+       even if it was not enabled in the configuration.

+       not work.
+
+    *) Bugfix: closing keepalive connections due to no free worker
+       connections might be too aggressive.
+       Thanks to Joel Cunningham.
+
+    *) Bugfix: an incorrect response might be returned when using the
+       "sendfile" directive on FreeBSD and macOS; the bug had appeared in
+       1.7.8.
+
+    *) Bugfix: a truncated response might be stored in cache when using the
+       "aio_write" directive.
+

+
+    *) Bugfix: if a server in an upstream in the stream module failed, it
+       was considered alive only when a test connection sent to it after
+       fail_timeout was closed; now a successfully established connection is
+       enough.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx/Windows could not be built with 64-bit Visual Studio.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx/Windows could not be built with OpenSSL 1.1.0.

+
+    *) Change: format of the $ssl_client_s_dn and $ssl_client_i_dn variables
+       has been changed to follow RFC 2253 (RFC 4514); values in the old
+       format are available in the $ssl_client_s_dn_legacy and
+       $ssl_client_i_dn_legacy variables.
+
+    *) Change: when storing temporary files in a cache directory they will

+
+Changes with nginx 1.11.5                                        11 Oct 2016
+
+    *) Change: the --with-ipv6 configure option was removed, now IPv6
+       support is configured automatically.
+
+    *) Change: now if there are no available servers in an upstream, nginx
+       will not reset number of failures of all servers as it previously
+       did, but will wait for fail_timeout to expire.
+
+    *) Feature: the ngx_stream_ssl_preread_module.
+
+    *) Feature: the "server" directive in the "upstream" context supports
+       the "max_conns" parameter.

+
+    *) Bugfix: flags passed by the --with-ld-opt configure option were not
+       used while building perl module.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the "add_after_body" directive when used with the
+       "sub_filter" directive.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the $realip_remote_addr variable.
+
+    *) Bugfix: the "dav_access", "proxy_store_access",

+       stream module.
+
+    *) Feature: the ngx_stream_realip_module.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built with the stream module and the

+
+    *) Feature: now nginx uses the IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT socket option
+       when available.
+
+    *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
+       using HTTP/2 and the "proxy_request_buffering" directive.
+
+    *) Bugfix: the "Content-Length" request header line was always added to
+       requests passed to backends, including requests without body, when
+       using HTTP/2.
+
+    *) Bugfix: "http request count is zero" alerts might appear in logs when
+       using HTTP/2.
+
+    *) Bugfix: unnecessary buffering might occur when using the "sub_filter"
+       directive; the issue had appeared in 1.9.4.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.11.1                                        31 May 2016
+
+    *) Security: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process while
+       writing a specially crafted request body to a temporary file
+       (CVE-2016-4450); the bug had appeared in 1.3.9.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.11.0                                        24 May 2016
+
+    *) Feature: the "transparent" parameter of the "proxy_bind",

+
+    *) Feature: the "map" directive supports combinations of multiple
+       variables as resulting values.
+
+    *) Feature: now nginx checks if EPOLLRDHUP events are supported by
+       kernel, and optimizes connection handling accordingly if the "epoll"
+       method is used.
+
+    *) Feature: the "ssl_certificate" and "ssl_certificate_key" directives
+       can be specified multiple times to load certificates of different
+       types (for example, RSA and ECDSA).
+
+    *) Feature: the "ssl_ecdh_curve" directive now allows specifying a list
+       of curves when using OpenSSL 1.0.2 or newer; by default a list built

+
+    *) Change: the "421 Misdirected Request" response now used when
+       rejecting requests to a virtual server different from one negotiated
+       during an SSL handshake; this improves interoperability with some
+       HTTP/2 clients when using client certificates.
+
+    *) Change: HTTP/2 clients can now start sending request body
+       immediately; the "http2_body_preread_size" directive controls size of
+       the buffer used before nginx will start reading client request body.
+
+    *) Bugfix: cached error responses were not updated when using the
+       "proxy_cache_bypass" directive.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.9.15                                        19 Apr 2016
+
+    *) Bugfix: "recv() failed" errors might occur when using HHVM as a
+       FastCGI server.
+
+    *) Bugfix: when using HTTP/2 and the "limit_req" or "auth_request"
+       directives a timeout or a "client violated flow control" error might
+       occur while reading client request body; the bug had appeared in
+       1.9.14.
+
+    *) Workaround: a response might not be shown by some browsers if HTTP/2
+       was used and client request body was not fully read; the bug had
+       appeared in 1.9.14.
+
+    *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "aio threads"
+       directive.
+       Thanks to Mindaugas Rasiukevicius.
+

+
+    *) Change: non-idempotent requests (POST, LOCK, PATCH) are no longer
+       passed to the next server by default if a request has been sent to a
+       backend; the "non_idempotent" parameter of the "proxy_next_upstream"
+       directive explicitly allows retrying such requests.
+
+    *) Feature: the ngx_http_perl_module can be built dynamically.
+
+    *) Feature: UDP support in the stream module.
+
+    *) Feature: the "aio_write" directive.
+
+    *) Feature: now cache manager monitors number of elements in caches and
+       tries to avoid cache keys zone overflows.
+
+    *) Bugfix: "task already active" and "second aio post" alerts might
+       appear in logs when using the "sendfile" and "aio" directives with
+       subrequests.
+
+    *) Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs if
+       caching was used and a client closed a connection prematurely.
+
+    *) Bugfix: connections with clients might be closed needlessly if
+       caching was used.
+       Thanks to Justin Li.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU if the "sendfile" directive was used on
+       Linux or Solaris and a file being sent was changed during sending.
+
+    *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "sendfile" and "aio
+       threads" directives.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the "proxy_pass", "fastcgi_pass", "scgi_pass", and
+       "uwsgi_pass" directives when using variables.
+       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
+
+    *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_sub_filter_module.
+
+    *) Bugfix: if an error occurred in a cached backend connection, the
+       request was passed to the next server regardless of the
+       proxy_next_upstream directive.
+
+    *) Bugfix: "CreateFile() failed" errors when creating temporary files on
+       Windows.
+
+
+Changes with nginx 1.9.12                                        24 Feb 2016

+       appeared in 1.9.11.
+       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
+
+    *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built statically with OpenSSL on Linux;
+       the bug had appeared in 1.9.11.
+
+    *) Bugfix: the "add_header ... always" directive with an empty value did
+       not delete "Last-Modified" and "ETag" header lines from error
+       responses.
+
+    *) Workaround: "called a function you should not call" and "shutdown
+       while in init" messages might appear in logs when using OpenSSL
+       1.0.2f.
+
+    *) Bugfix: invalid headers might be logged incorrectly.
+
+    *) Bugfix: socket leak when using HTTP/2.

+
+    *) Security: invalid pointer dereference might occur during DNS server
+       response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
+       attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
+       cause segmentation fault in a worker process (CVE-2016-0742).
+
+    *) Security: use-after-free condition might occur during CNAME response
+       processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker
+       who is able to trigger name resolution to cause segmentation fault in
+       a worker process, or might have potential other impact
+       (CVE-2016-0746).
+
+    *) Security: CNAME resolution was insufficiently limited if the
+       "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to
+       trigger arbitrary name resolution to cause excessive resource
+       consumption in worker processes (CVE-2016-0747).
+

+       when using the "keepalive" directive.
+
+    *) Bugfix: proxying used the HTTP method of the original request after
+       an "X-Accel-Redirect" redirection.
+

+       alerts", "record too small", и "got a fin before a ccs" понижен с
+       уровня crit до info.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании HTTP/2 и директивы error_page для
+       перенаправления ошибок с кодом 400 могла происходить утечка сокетов.
+
+    *) Исправление: сообщения об ошибках записи в syslog не содержали

+
+    *) Исправление: при возврате диапазонов nginx не удалял строку заголовка
+       "Content-Range", если она присутствовала в исходном ответе бэкенда.
+
+    *) Исправление: проксированный ответ мог быть отправлен не полностью при
+       переконфигурации на Linux; ошибка появилась в 1.17.5.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 1.23.0                                          21.06.2022
+
+    *) Изменение во внутреннем API: теперь строки заголовков представлены

+       через переменные "$http_...", "$sent_http_...", "$sent_trailer_...",
+       "$upstream_http_..." и "$upstream_trailer_...".
+
+    *) Исправление: если в заголовке ответа бэкенда было несколько строк
+       "Vary", при кэшировании nginx учитывал только последнюю из них.
+
+    *) Исправление: если в заголовке ответа бэкенда было несколько строк
+       "WWW-Authenticate" и использовался перехват ошибок с кодом 401 от
+       бэкенда или директива auth_request, nginx пересылал клиенту только
+       первую из этих строк.
+
+    *) Изменение: уровень логгирования ошибок SSL "application data after
+       close notify" понижен с уровня crit до info.
+
+    *) Исправление: соединения могли зависать, если nginx был собран на
+       Linux 2.6.17 и новее, а использовался на системах без поддержки
+       EPOLLRDHUP, в частности, на системах с эмуляцией epoll; ошибка
+       появилась в 1.17.5.
+       Спасибо Marcus Ball.
+
+    *) Исправление: nginx не кэшировал ответ, если строка заголовка ответа
+       "Expires" запрещала кэширование, а последующая строка заголовка
+       "Cache-Control" разрешала кэширование.

+       nginx возвращал в ответах строку заголовка "Connection: keep-alive".
+
+    *) Исправление: в директиве ssl_session_ticket_key при использовании
+       TLSv1.3.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 1.21.5                                          28.12.2021

+
+    *) Безопасность: при использовании директивы resolver во время обработки
+       ответа DNS-сервера могла происходить перезапись одного байта памяти,
+       что позволяло атакующему, имеющему возможность подделывать UDP-пакеты
+       от DNS-сервера, вызвать падение рабочего процесса или, потенциально,

+
+    *) Исправление: при ожидании задержки limit_req или auth_delay, а также
+       при работе с бэкендами nginx мог не обнаружить, что соединение уже
+       закрыто клиентом.
+
+    *) Исправление: в методе обработки соединений eventport.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 1.19.8                                          09.03.2021

+       "421 Misdirected Request"; это улучшает совместимость с некоторыми
+       HTTP/2-клиентами в случае использования клиентских сертификатов.
+
+    *) Изменение: HTTP/2-клиенты теперь могут сразу присылать тело запроса;
+       директива http2_body_preread_size позволяет указать размер буфера,

+    *) Изменение: неидемпотентные запросы (POST, LOCK, PATCH) теперь по
+       умолчанию не передаются на другой сервер, если запрос уже был
+       отправлен на бэкенд; параметр non_idempotent директивы
+       proxy_next_upstream явно разрешает повторять такие запросы.
+
+    *) Добавление: модуль ngx_http_perl_module теперь можно собрать
+       динамически.
+
+    *) Добавление: поддержка UDP в модуле stream.
+
+    *) Добавление: директива aio_write.

+       могли закрываться без необходимости.
+       Спасибо Justin Li.
+
+    *) Исправление: nginx мог нагружать процессор при использовании
+       директивы sendfile на Linux и Solaris, если отправляемый файл был
+       изменён в процессе отправки.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании директив sendfile и "aio threads"
+       соединения могли зависать.
+

+       появилась в 1.9.11.
+
+    *) Исправление: директива "add_header ... always" с пустым значением не
+       удаляла из заголовков ошибочных ответов строки Last-Modified и ETag.
+
+    *) Изменение: при использовании OpenSSL 1.0.2f в логах могли появляться

+       игнорировала обычные файлы.
+       Спасибо Damien Tournoud.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании директивы sendfile на OS X возникали
+       ошибки "sendfile() failed"; ошибка появилась в nginx 1.7.8.

+       кэшировать ответ (например, при использовании proxy_cache_min_uses).
+
+    *) Изменение: теперь после истечения proxy_cache_lock_timeout nginx
+       отправляет запрос на бэкенд без кэширования; новые директивы
+       proxy_cache_lock_age, fastcgi_cache_lock_age, scgi_cache_lock_age и

+    *) Изменение: теперь nginx учитывает при кэшировании строку "Vary" в
+       заголовке ответа бэкенда.
+
+    *) Добавление: директивы proxy_force_ranges, fastcgi_force_ranges,
+       scgi_force_ranges и uwsgi_force_ranges.
+
+    *) Добавление: директивы proxy_limit_rate, fastcgi_limit_rate,
+       scgi_limit_rate и uwsgi_limit_rate.

+    *) Добавление: параметр Vary директив proxy_ignore_headers,
+       fastcgi_ignore_headers, scgi_ignore_headers и uwsgi_ignore_headers.
+
+    *) Исправление: последняя часть ответа, полученного от бэкенда при
+       небуферизированном проксировании, могла не отправляться клиенту, если
+       использовались директивы gzip или gunzip.
+
+    *) Исправление: в директиве proxy_cache_revalidate.
+       Спасибо Piotr Sikora.
+
+    *) Исправление: в обработке ошибок.

+
+
+Изменения в nginx 1.7.5                                           16.09.2014

+
+    *) Безопасность: если nginx был собран с модулем ngx_http_realip_module,
+       то при использовании директивы "satisfy_any on" директивы доступа и
+       аутентификации не работали. Модуль ngx_http_realip_module не
+       собирался и не собирается по умолчанию.

+    *) Исправление: nginx считал небезопасными URI, в которых между двумя
+       слэшами находилось два любых символа; ошибка появилась в 0.3.8.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.3.8                                           09.11.2005
+
+    *) Безопасность: nginx теперь проверят URI, полученные от бэкенда в

+       запросами клиентов.
+
+    *) Исправление: рабочие процессы не сбрасывали буферизированные логи при
+       плавном выходе.
+
+    *) Исправление: если URI запроса изменялось с помощью rewrite, а затем
+       запрос проксировался в location, заданном регулярным выражением, то
+       бэкенду передавался неверный запрос; ошибка появилась в 0.2.6.
+
+    *) Исправление: директива expires не удаляла уже установленную строку
+       заголовка "Expires".
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании метода rtsig и нескольких рабочих
+       процессах nginx мог перестать принимать запросы.
+
+    *) Исправление: в SSI командах неверно обрабатывались строки "\"" и
+       "\'".

+       $name.
+
+    *) Исправление: если хотя бы в одном сервере не было описано ни одной
+       директивы listen, то nginx не слушал на 80 порту; ошибка появилась в
+       0.3.3.
+
+    *) Исправление: если в директиве proxy_pass отсутствовал URI, то всегда
+       использовался порт 80.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.3.5                                           21.10.2005
+
+    *) Исправление: если логин IMAP/POP3 менялся сервером авторизации, то
+       мог произойти segmentation fault; ошибка появилась в 0.2.2.
+
+    *) Исправление: accept mutex не работал, все соединения обрабатывались
+       одним рабочим процессом; ошибка появилась в 0.3.3.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании метода rtsig и директивы
+       timer_resolution не работали таймауты.

+
+    *) Исправление: nginx не собирался на Linux 2.4+ и MacOS X; ошибка
+       появилась в 0.3.3.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.3.3                                           19.10.2005
+
+    *) Изменение: параметры "bl" и "af" директивы listen переименованы в
+       "backlog" и "accept_filter".
+
+    *) Добавление: параметры "rcvbuf" и "sndbuf" в директиве listen.
+
+    *) Изменение: параметр лога $msec теперь не требует дополнительного
+       системного вызова gettimeofday().
+
+    *) Добавление: ключ -t теперь проверяет директивы listen.
+
+    *) Исправление: если в директиве listen был указан неверный адрес, то
+       nginx после сигнала -HUP оставлял открытый сокет в состоянии CLOSED.
+
+    *) Исправление: для индексных файлов, содержащих в имени переменную, мог
+       неверно выставляться тип mime по умолчанию; ошибка появилась в 0.3.0.
+
+    *) Добавление: директива timer_resolution.
+
+    *) Добавление: параметр лога $upstream_response_time в миллисекундах.

+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.3.0                                           07.10.2005
+
+    *) Изменение: убрано десятидневное ограничение времени работы рабочего

+       переданный charset.
+
+    *) Исправление: если после изменения URI в блоке if для запроса не
+       находилась новая конфигурация, то правила модуля
+       ngx_http_rewrite_module выполнялись снова.
+
+    *) Исправление: если директива set устанавливала переменную модуля
+       ngx_http_geo_module в какой-либо части конфигурации, то эта
+       переменная не была доступна в других частях конфигурации и выдавалась
+       ошибка "using uninitialized variable"; ошибка появилась в 0.2.2.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.2.5                                           04.10.2005

+       HTTPS.
+
+

+
+    *) Исправление: если все бэкенды, используемые для балансировки
+       нагрузки, оказывались в нерабочем состоянии после одной ошибки, то
+       nginx мог зациклится; ошибка появилась в 0.2.0.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.2.0                                           23.09.2005
+
+    *) Изменились имена pid-файлов, используемые во время обновления
+       исполняемого файла. Ручное переименование теперь не нужно. Старый
+       основной процесс добавляет к своему pid-файл суффикс ".oldbin" и
+       запускает новый исполняемый файл. Новый основной процесс создаёт
+       обычный pid-файл без суффикса ".newbin". Если новый основной процесс
+       выходит, то старый процесс переименовывает свой pid-файл c суффиксом
+       ".oldbin" в pid-файл без суффикса. При обновлении с версии 0.1.х до
+       0.2.0 нужно учитывать, что оба процесса - старый 0.1.x и новый
+       0.2.0 - используют pid-файл без суффиксов.
+
+    *) Изменение: директива worker_connections, новое название директивы
+       connections; директива теперь задаёт максимальное число соединений, а
+       не максимально возможный номер дескриптора для сокета.
+

+       рабочего процесса.
+
+    *) Добавление: директива satisfy_any.
+
+    *) Изменение: модули ngx_http_access_module и ngx_http_auth_basic_module
+       не работают для подзапросов.
+
+    *) Добавление: директивы worker_rlimit_nofile и
+       worker_rlimit_sigpending.
+
+    *) Исправление: если все бэкенды, используемые для балансировки
+       нагрузки, оказывались в нерабочем состоянии после одной ошибки, то
+       nginx не обращался к ним в течение 60 секунд.
+
+    *) Исправление: в парсинге аргументов IMAP/POP3 команд.
+       Спасибо Rob Mueller.
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибки при использовании SSL в IMAP/POP3 прокси.
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибки при использовании SSI и сжатия.
+
+    *) Исправление: в ответах 304 не добавлялись строки заголовка ответа
+       "Expires" и "Cache-Control".
+       Спасибо Александру Кукушкину.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.45                                          08.09.2005
+
+    *) Изменение: директива ssl_engine упразднена в модуле
+       ngx_http_ssl_module и перенесена на глобальный уровень.
+
+    *) Исправление: ответы с подзапросами, включённые с помощью SSI, не
+       передавались через SSL соединение.
+
+    *) Разные исправления в IMAP/POP3 прокси.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.44                                          06.09.2005
+
+    *) Добавление: IMAP/POP3 прокси поддерживает SSL.
+
+    *) Добавление: директива proxy_timeout модуля ngx_imap_proxy_module.
+
+    *) Добавление: директива userid_mark.
+
+    *) Добавление: значение переменной $remote_user определяется независимо
+       от того, используется ли авторизация или нет.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.43                                          30.08.2005

+    *) Добавление: listen(2) backlog в директиве listen можно менять по
+       сигналу -HUP.
+
+    *) Добавление: скрипт geo2nginx.pl добавлен в contrib.
+
+    *) Изменение: параметры FastCGI с пустым значениями теперь передаются
+       серверу.
+
+    *) Исправление: если в ответе проксированного сервера или FastCGI
+       сервера была строка "Cache-Control", то при использовании директивы
+       expires происходил segmentation fault или рабочий процесс мог
+       зациклится; в режиме прокси ошибка появилась в 0.1.29.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.42                                          23.08.2005
+
+    *) Исправление: если URI запроса получался нулевой длины после обработки
+       модулем ngx_http_rewrite_module, то в модуле ngx_http_proxy_module
+       происходил segmentation fault или bus error.
+
+    *) Исправление: директива limit_rate не работала внутри блока if; ошибка
+       появилась в 0.1.38.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.41                                          25.07.2005
+
+    *) Исправление: если переменная использовалась в файле конфигурации, то
+       она не могла использоваться в SSI.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.40                                          22.07.2005

+       логе не помещалась информация, связанная с этим запросом.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании "X-Accel-Redirect" не передавалась
+       строка "Set-Cookie"; ошибка появилась в 0.1.39.

+       строка "Content-Disposition".
+
+    *) Исправление: по сигналу SIGQUIT основной процесс не закрывал сокеты,
+       на которых он слушал.
+
+    *) Исправление: после обновления исполняемого файла на лету на Linux и
+       Solaris название процесса в команде ps становилось короче.

+
+    *) Изменения в модуле ngx_http_charset_module: директива default_charset

+       передавался относительный URL, то к нему добавлялось имя хоста и
+       слэш; ошибка появилась в 0.1.14.
+
+    *) Исправление: на Linux в лог не записывался текст системной ошибки.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.16                                          25.01.2005
+
+    *) Исправление: если ответ передавался chunk'ами, то при запросе HEAD
+       выдавался завершающий chunk.
+
+    *) Исправление: заголовок "Connection: keep-alive" выдавался, даже если
+       директива keepalive_timeout запрещала использование keep-alive.
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибки в модуле ngx_http_fastcgi_module вызывали
+       segmentation fault.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании SSL сжатый ответ мог передаваться не
+       до конца.
+
+    *) Исправление: опции TCP_NODELAY, TCP_NOPUSH и TCP_CORK, специфичные
+       для TCP сокетов, не используются для unix domain сокетов.

+    *) Добавление: директива rewrite поддерживает перезаписывание
+       аргументов.
+
+    *) Исправление: на запрос POST с заголовком "Content-Length: 0"
+       возвращался ответ 400; ошибка появилась в 0.1.14.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.15                                          19.01.2005
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибка соединения с FastCGI-сервером вызывала
+       segmentation fault.
+
+    *) Исправление: корректная обработка регулярного выражения, в котором
+       число выделенных частей не совпадает с числом подстановок.
+
+    *) Добавление: location, который передаётся FastCGI-серверу, может быть
+       задан с помощью регулярного выражения.
+
+    *) Исправление: параметр FastCGI REQUEST_URI теперь передаётся вместе с
+       аргументами и в том виде, в котором был получен от клиента.
+
+    *) Исправление: для использования регулярных выражений в location нужно
+       было собирать nginx вместе с ngx_http_rewrite_module.
+
+    *) Исправление: если бэкенд слушал на 80-ом порту, то при использовании
+       директивы "proxy_preserve_host on" в заголовке "Host" указывался
+       также порт 80; ошибка появилась в 0.1.14.
+
+    *) Исправление: если задать одинаковые пути в параметрах
+       автоконфигурации --http-client-body-temp-path=PATH и
+       --http-proxy-temp-path=PATH или --http-client-body-temp-path=PATH и
+       --http-fastcgi-temp-path=PATH, то происходил segmentation fault.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.14                                          18.01.2005

+    *) Добавление: параметры автоконфигурации
+       --http-client-body-temp-path=PATH, --http-proxy-temp-path=PATH и
+       --http-fastcgi-temp-path=PATH
+
+    *) Изменение: имя каталога с временными файлами, содержащие тело запроса
+       клиента, задаётся директивой client_body_temp_path, по умолчанию
+       <prefix>/client_body_temp.

+    *) Добавление: модуль ngx_http_fastcgi_module и директивы fastcgi_pass,
+       fastcgi_root, fastcgi_index, fastcgi_params, fastcgi_connect_timeout,
+       fastcgi_send_timeout, fastcgi_read_timeout, fastcgi_send_lowat,
+       fastcgi_header_buffer_size, fastcgi_buffers,

+       fastcgi_max_temp_file_size, fastcgi_temp_file_write_size,
+       fastcgi_next_upstream и fastcgi_x_powered_by.
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибка "[alert] zero size buf"; ошибка появилась в
+       0.1.3.
+
+    *) Изменение: в директиве proxy_pass нужно обязательно указывать URI
+       после имени хоста.
+
+    *) Изменение: если в URI встречался символ %3F, то он считался началом
+       строки аргументов.
+
+    *) Добавление: поддержка unix domain сокетов в модуле
+       ngx_http_proxy_module.
+
+    *) Добавление: директивы ssl_engine и ssl_ciphers.
+       Спасибо Сергею Скворцову за SSL-акселератор.

+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.13                                          21.12.2004
+
+    *) Добавление: директивы server_names_hash и
+       server_names_hash_threshold.

+    *) Исправление: параметр лога %request_length записывал неверную длину.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.12                                          06.12.2004
+
+    *) Добавление: параметр лога %request_length.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании /dev/poll, select и poll на
+       платформах, где возможны ложные срабатывания указанных методов, могли
+       быть длительные задержки при обработке запроса по keep-alive
+       соединению. Наблюдалось по крайней мере на Solaris с использованием
+       /dev/poll.
+
+    *) Исправление: директива send_lowat игнорируется на Linux, так как
+       Linux не поддерживает опцию SO_SNDLOWAT.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.11                                          02.12.2004
+
+    *) Добавление: директива worker_priority.
+
+    *) Изменение: под FreeBSD директивы tcp_nopush и tcp_nodelay вместе
+       влияют на передачу ответа.
+
+    *) Исправление: nginx не вызывал initgroups().
+       Спасибо Андрею Ситникову и Андрею Нигматулину.
+
+    *) Изменение: ngx_http_auto_index_module теперь выдаёт размер файлов в
+       байтах.
+
+    *) Исправление: ngx_http_auto_index_module возвращал ошибку 500, если в
+       каталоге есть битый symlink.
+
+    *) Исправление: файлы больше 4G не передавались с использованием
+       sendfile.
+
+    *) Исправление: если бэкенд резолвился в несколько адресов и при
+       ожидании от него ответа происходила ошибка, то процесс зацикливался.
+
+    *) Исправление: при использовании метода /dev/poll рабочий процесс мог
+       завершиться с сообщением "unknown cycle".
+
+    *) Исправление: ошибки "close() channel failed".
+
+    *) Исправление: автоматическое определение групп nobody и nogroup.
+
+    *) Исправление: директива send_lowat не работала на Linux.

+Изменения в nginx 0.1.10                                          26.11.2004
+
+    *) Исправление: если в запросе без аргументов есть "//", "/./", "/../"
+       или "%XX", то терялся последний символ в строке запроса; ошибка
+       появилась в 0.1.9.
+
+    *) Исправление: исправление в версии 0.1.9 для файлов больше 2G на Linux
+       не работало.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.9                                           25.11.2004
+
+    *) Исправление: если в запросе есть "//", "/./", "/../" или "%XX", то
+       проксируемый запрос передавался без аргументов.
+
+    *) Исправление: при сжатии больших ответов иногда они передавались не
+       полностью.
+
+    *) Исправление: не передавались файлы больше 2G на Linux,
+       неподдерживающем sendfile64().
+
+    *) Исправление: на Linux при конфигурации сборки нужно было обязательно
+       использовать параметр --with-poll_module; ошибка появилась в 0.1.8.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.8                                           20.11.2004

+    *) Исправление: при некоторых комбинациях директив location c
+       регулярными выражениями использовалась конфигурация не из того
+       location.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.5                                           11.11.2004
+
+    *) Исправление: на Solaris и Linux могло быть очень много сообщений
+       "recvmsg() returned not enough data".
+
+    *) Исправление: в режиме прокси без использования sendfile на Solaris
+       возникала ошибка "writev() failed (22: Invalid argument)". На других
+       платформах, не поддерживающих sendfile, процесс зацикливался.

+    *) Добавление: директива userid_p3p.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.4                                           26.10.2004
+

+
+    *) Исправление: модуль сжатия сжимал уже сжатые ответы, полученные при
+       проксировании.
+
+
+Изменения в nginx 0.1.1                                           11.10.2004
